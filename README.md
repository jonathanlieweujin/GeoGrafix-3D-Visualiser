# GeoGrafix-3D-Visualiser
A two-week assignment project for the SC40103: Scientific Data Visualization.

This assignment aims to leverage the VTK library for creating a 3D Visualiser capable of loading and displaying various actors within the VTK scene. The visualiser extends its functionality to allow seamless manipulation of actor details, including location, rotation, scaling, and colour adjustments. Additionally, it allows users to export modified actor properties into their respective file formats.
